        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>There once was a barren cave with nothing living in it but the cave people. These people are the only beings in this cave there is nothing but the walls and floors of the cave for them to touch. The cave people have only known what is inside the cave. They are accustomed to the cave and have never left. They have chosen to never leave the cave because they are comfortable there. They have no idea what life outside the cave is like. They have never been outside the cave, so they have no idea what could be out there. All they can see is what is on the cave wall in front of them. The diamond on the wall has been there for as long as they have known the cave. It is all they know that exists outside of their reach. To the cave people, the diamond they see is just a mere silhouette of the object outside of the cave. This silhouette of the diamond has always remained still and flat with no 3D dimensions. The diamond has always stayed the same on the wall, it has not moved or changed at all. <span class="clickable" id="first-change"> Until one day the diamond started to spin. </span></p>

        <p>The diamond began to spin on its own. The cave people can see it spinning on the cave wall. They were so used to the stillness of the diamond and its shadow that when it spun, they would notice instantly. The only light in the cave is focused on the main cave wall. This light makes it so the cave people can only see the diamond on the wall. The rest of the cave is lit dimly so the cave people cannot see anything but what is on the cave wall. The cave wall is a flat surface that has the shadows of the objects that are in the outside world. Since the cave people can only see the shadows of the objects, they do not know the complete dimensions of them. Without knowing the complete dimensions, the cave people have no idea what the objects could actually be. The shadows of the objects are only 2D silhouettes which are flat. Together the flat cave wall surface and the 2D shadows define the flatness that the cave people can only see. The cave people only understand the flatness before them and not the concept of anything beyond 2D dimensions. <span class="clickable" id="second-change"> The diamond began to move across the wall from side to side.</span></p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>The scene has now changed, we can now see what the people on the outside of the cave can see. On the outside of the cave, we can see that the diamond is not 2D but actually a 3D shape. The people outside the cave understand the concept of 3D shapes and can see that in front of them outside the cave. But the people on the outside of the cave cannot see what is happening inside the cave. With that in mind, the outside people do not understand what the cave people know as reality. The outside people know what is happening in the outside world and understand that shapes have 3D dimensions. The people on the outside of the cave have seen the world and know what it is like. The objects they see are tangible and are exactly as how they see them. The outside people see the diamond as a 3D shape and see it moving. In contrast, the cave people see the silhouette of a diamond but they do not know if it is actually a diamond or not. The cave people fear what the diamond shadow could actually be in the outside world and thatâ€™s why they stay in the cave.<span class="clickable" id="third-change"> The diamond split in half, became two cones and they began to rotate around.</span></p>

        <p>The diamond has split into two cones. They now rotate and move across the scene back and forth. The diamond splitting into two makes both the cave people and the outside people wonder what was or was not whole. The diamond as a whole is actually in fact the people seeing double without knowing it. The diamond in reality being two cones is hard to see when they move seamlessly together. But when they split apart to rotate, both the cave people and the outside people can fully understand that they were seeing two shapes attached. In contrast, the cave people do not know that the two shapes are three-dimensional cones because all they see is a flat diamond and then two flat triangles. The outside people can see that the diamond was two cones but do not understand that the cave people can only see flat shapes. In order to grasp the full truth of what both sets of people can see we have to combine the 2D and 3D views. Being able to see the cave wall with the shadow and see the shapes moving outside the cave allows for an understanding of what perspective means. We can understand all perspectives by seeing both views combined. <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> Each cone came to rest at either side of the cave, the light went out now the cave people are left in the dark.</span></p>
