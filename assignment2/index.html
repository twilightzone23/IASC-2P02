    <h1>Data Visualization of <i>The Hunger Games</i></h1>
    <h2>Paige Baziuk</h2>

    <p>For this project, the text I have chosen is the novel <i>The Hunger Games</i> by Suzanne Collins. This book is written from the perspective of the main character Katniss Everdeen who lives in the dystopian nation of Panem in North America. This nation is run by the government which is called The Capital which hosts the annual event of The Hunger Games. These games require one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen from each of the twelve districts to fight in a battle to the death until one victor remains. I chose <i>The Hunger Games</i> for this project because I am familiar with it, and I have enjoyed the film series ever since they came out. Additionally, I believe it would be interesting to look at some of the positive and negative themes in the novel with data visualization.</p>

    <p>This first visualization depicts Katniss’ passions throughout the book. These passions are shown in this visualization by counting the I believe are related to Katniss’ passions and these terms are hope, Peeta, and love. I found with all the sadness and chaos in the book I would like to highlight the passions of Katniss to see the positives in the book. I decided to make the shapes lighter in color to represent positivity and passion. Two insights I can make about the text based on the visualization are about Peeta and the choice of shape for the objects. The first insight is about the second main character in the novel Peeta who is one of the tributes that goes into the games with Katniss, and they end up falling in love. The data visualization shows how many times Peeta is mentioned through Katniss’ perspective which illustrates how strong a relationship they have. The number of times Peeta is mentioned throughout the book is shown through all the blue bubbles which is a lot. The second insight of this visualization is about how I chose spheres to represent objects about passions. I chose spheres because I believe it represents softness and positivity whereas shapes with corners like squares represent more negative ideas like chaos.</p>

    <p>For this section, you can animate the objects by checking the animate check box which will make the shapes spin. This second visualization shows the themes within the events of the games in the novel. All these themes are represented through the highlighted terms tributes, death, and survival. I believe these terms represent what happened with the games because tributes are the people who are put into the games, death is what happens throughout the entirety of the games, and survival is what the tributes try to accomplish to win the games. These terms are shown in the visualization with cone objects that are in a variety of dark colours. The cones and dark colours represent the darkness and chaos of these terms throughout the book. </p>

    <p>Two insights I can make about this visualization are the animation of the cones and the amount of the term survival used. The first insight is about the animation of the cones spinning. I animated the cones to spin because I believe it represents how chaotic the terms are and how they clash with each other. I want to show the anger and violence that goes through the games through this animation. The second insight is about how few times the term survival is used throughout the text which is represented through the number of red cones. I found this interesting to highlight because it shows survival is not a constant thread through the text whereas death is constant. We see the death term constantly throughout the text as shown by the visualization, but survival is very few and spaced out sparsely. I believe this shows how few people survive throughout the text and how sad all the death is.</p>

        <h2>Themes of the Games in <i>The Hunger Games</i></h2>

    </div>

    <p>In conclusion, a variety of different themes can be shown through these two visualizations. One thing I would have liked to have accomplished but could not figure out would be how to move the positions of the objects to make a shape like the mocking jay pin in <i>The Hunger Games</i> movies. I believe that was too complicated within the amount of time we had to do the assignment. The current visualizations within this project could be improved by making the objects animate in more unique ways or have different positions. I believe making the objects animate differently would make the visualizations more visually interesting and could show new insights. The objects having different positions would also make the visualizations more interesting visually and further the meaning of the insights I already made. These visualizations have furthered my understanding of themes throughout the novel and opened my eyes to new ideas in the book.</p>
